## 3.1 FAMILY: ACCESS CONTROL
### AC-2 ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT
#### AC-2(1) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | AUTOMATED SYSTEM ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT
This F5 solution employs automated mechanisms to support the management of information system accounts.
Authentication and authorization of all information system accounts is done via Azure AD, including accounts used to access the individual infrastructure components of the solution such as the F5 appliances, the servers and the firewalls, as well as for access to the applications serviced and contained within this infrastructure.
When users are terminated or transferred, the F5 solution automatically and immediately reflects the change in authorization for the corresponding accounts and enforces the corresponding actions (authorize or deny access).
The F5 solution captures audit and logging reports detailing the account usage.

#### AC-2(2) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | REMOVAL OF TEMPORARY / EMERGENCY ACCOUNTS
This F5 solution automatically disables temporary and emergency accounts that have expired without requiring the intervention of a systems administrator. This is accomplished by leveraging the Azure AD attributes that identify the status of each account and by programing the desired logic in the F5 Visual Policy Editor, such as setting the appropriate expiry time for the authorized access after the temporary or emergency account has been successfully authorized, and this is enforced for access to the individual infrastructure components of the solution such as the F5 appliances, the servers and the firewalls, as well as for access to the applications serviced and contained within this infrastructure.

#### AC-2(3) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | DISABLE INACTIVE ACCOUNTS
This F5 solution automatically disables inactive accounts after the defined time period has elapsed.
This is accomplished by leveraging the Azure AD attributes that identify the last successful login of each account and by programing the desired logic in the F5 Visual Policy Editor to automatically deny access to an account that has been inactive for longer than the defined time period after the account has been successfully authorized, and this is enforced for access to the individual infrastructure components of the solution such as the F5 appliances, the servers and the firewalls, as well as for access to the applications serviced and contained within this infrastructure.

#### AC-2(5) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | INACTIVITY LOGOUT
This F5 solution automatically logs out users when the defined time-period of inactivity has elapsed.
This is accomplished by configuration of the "Inactivity Timeout" setting in the Access policy and is enforced for access to the individual infrastructure components of the solution such as the F5 appliances, the servers and the firewalls, as well as for access to the applications serviced and contained within this infrastructure.

#### AC-2(6) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | DYNAMIC PRIVILEGE MANAGEMENT
This F5 solution automatically, dynamically and immediately enforces access controls continuously over the entire duration of a user's authorized session. This is also commonly referred to as the "Zero Trust" access model. The solution also enforces "step-up authentication" to dynamically adjust the privileges of users based on any number of parameters, including time of day, sub-systems they are attempting to access, or changes in their device's posture, such as disabling their client anti-virus software or becoming infected with malware, and allows for the encryption of the communications to be changed, including changing the encryption keys and requesting client-provided certificate authentication, also referred to as "mutual authentication". This is accomplished with the configuration of the corresponding logic in the F5 access policy definition and is enforced for access to the individual infrastructure components of the solution such as the F5 appliances, the servers and the firewalls, as well as for access to the applications serviced and contained within this infrastructure.

#### AC-2(7) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | ROLE-BASED SCHEMES
This F5 solution automatically, dynamically and continually enforces access controls continuously over the entire duration of a user's authorized session and in accordance with the user's assigned roles, as defined in Azure AD by the organization. Accordingly, the F5 solution grants or denies access for privileged user accounts as applicable and as defined by the organization. When privileged role assignments change and access becomes no longer appropriate, the F5 solution denies access. This is accomplished with the configuration of the corresponding logic in the F5 access policy definition and is enforced for access to the individual infrastructure components of the solution such as the F5 appliances, the servers and the firewalls, as well as for access to the applications serviced and contained within this infrastructure.

#### AC-2(8) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | DYNAMIC ACCOUNT CREATION
This F5 solution federates identity and authorization of accounts with Azure AD to dynamically create information system accounts for entities that were previously unknow. This is accomplished with the configuration of the corresponding logic in the F5 access policy definition and is enforced for access to the individual infrastructure components of the solution such as the F5 appliances, the servers and the firewalls, as well as for access to the applications serviced and contained within this infrastructure.

#### AC-2(9) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF SHARED GROUPS / ACCOUNTS
This F5 solution only allows access for shared/group accounts that meet the conditions as defined by the organization in Azure AD. This is accomplished with the configuration of the corresponding logic in the F5 access policy definition and is enforced for access to the individual infrastructure components of the solution such as the F5 appliances, the servers and the firewalls, as well as for access to the applications serviced and contained within this infrastructure.

#### AC-2(11) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | USAGE CONDITIONS
This F5 solution enforces circumstances and/or usage conditions for information system accounts as defined by the organization in Azure AD, including restricting usage to certain days of the week, time of day or specific durations of time. This is accomplished with the configuration of the corresponding logic in the F5 access policy definition and is enforced for access to the individual infrastructure components of the solution such as the F5 appliances, the servers and the firewalls, as well as for access to the applications serviced and contained within this infrastructure.

#### AC-2(12) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | ACCOUNT MONITORING / ATYPICAL USAGE
This F5 solution monitors and reports information system accounts for atypical use as defined by the organization, including attempts to access at certain times of the day and from locations that are not consistent with the normal usage patterns of individuals working in organizations. This is accomplished with the configuration of the corresponding logic in the F5 access policy definition and is enforced for access to the individual infrastructure components of the solution such as the F5 appliances, the servers and the firewalls, as well as for access to the applications serviced and contained within this infrastructure.

#### AC-2(13) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | DISABLE ACCOUNTS FOR HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS
This F5 solution disables access for accounts immediately upon the organization identifying in Azure AD that the corresponding user poses a significant risk. This is accomplished with the configuration of the corresponding logic in the F5 access policy definition and is enforced for access to the individual infrastructure components of the solution such as the F5 appliances, the servers and the firewalls, as well as for access to the applications serviced and contained within this infrastructure.

### AC-3 ACCESS ENFORCEMENT
#### AC-3(2) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | DUAL AUTHORIZATION
This F5 solution enforces dual authorization, also known as two-person control, for organization-defined privileged commands and/or actions. This is accomplished with the configuration of the corresponding logic in the F5 access policy definition, including notification of request for authorization to the two persons, and is enforced for access to the individual infrastructure components of the solution such as the F5 appliances, the servers and the firewalls, as well as for access to the applications serviced and contained within this infrastructure.

#### AC-3(3) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | MANDATORY ACCESS CONTROL
This F5 solution enforcesâ€¦ 

The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined mandatory access control policies] over all subjects and objects where the policy specifies that:

The policy is uniformly enforced across all subjects and objects within the boundary of the information system;
A subject that has been granted access to information is constrained from doing any of the following;
Passing the information to unauthorized subjects or objects;
Granting its privileges to other subjects;
Changing one or more security attributes on subjects, objects, the information system, or information system components;
Choosing the security attributes and attribute values to be associated with newly created or modified objects; or
Changing the rules governing access control; and
[Assignment: Organized-defined subjects] may explicitly be granted [Assignment: organization-defined privileges (i.e., they are trusted subjects)] such that they are not limited by some or all of the above constraints.
Enhancement Supplemental Guidance Mandatory access control as defined in this control enhancement is synonymous with nondiscretionary access control, and is not constrained only to certain historical uses (e.g., implementations using the Bell-LaPadula Model). The above class of mandatory access control policies constrains what actions subjects can take with information obtained from data objects for which they have already been granted access, thus preventing the subjects from passing the information to unauthorized subjects and objects. This class of mandatory access control policies also constrains what actions subjects can take with respect to the propagation of access control privileges; that is, a subject with a privilege cannot pass that privilege to other subjects. The policy is uniformly enforced over all subjects and objects to which the information system has control. Otherwise, the access control policy can be circumvented. This enforcement typically is provided via an implementation that meets the reference monitor concept (see AC-25). The policy is bounded by the information system boundary (i.e., once the information is passed outside of the control of the system, additional means may be required to ensure that the constraints on the information remain in effect). The trusted subjects described above are granted privileges consistent with the concept of least privilege (see AC-6). Trusted subjects are only given the minimum privileges relative to the above policy necessary for satisfying organizational mission/business needs. The control is most applicable when there is a mandate (e.g., law, Executive Order, directive, or regulation) that establishes a policy regarding access to sensitive/classified information and that some users of the information system are not authorized access to all sensitive/classified information resident in the information system. This control can operate in conjunction with AC-3 (4). A subject that is constrained in its operation by policies governed by this control is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of AC-3 (4), but policies governed by this control take precedence over the less rigorous constraints of AC-3 (4). For example, while a mandatory access control policy imposes a constraint preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity label, AC-3 (4) permits the subject to pass the information to any subject with the same sensitivity label as the subject. Related controls: AC-25, SC-11.

#### AC-3(4) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | DISCRETIONARY ACCESS CONTROL
This F5 solution enforcesâ€¦ 

The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined discretionary access control policies] over defined subjects and objects where the policy specifies that a subject that has been granted access to information can do one or more of the following:

Pass the information to any other subjects or objects;
Grant its privileges to other subjects;
Change security attributes on subjects, objects, the information system, or the information systemâ€™s components;
Choose the security attributes to be associated with newly created or revised objects; or
Change the rules governing access control.
Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects. This control enhancement can operate in conjunction with AC-3 (3). A subject that is constrained in its operation by policies governed by AC-3 (3) is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this control enhancement. Thus, while AC-3 (3) imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, AC-3 (4) permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The policy is bounded by the information system boundary. Once the information is passed outside of the control of the information system, additional means may be required to ensure that the constraints remain in effect. While the older, more traditional definitions of discretionary access control require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this use of discretionary access control.

#### AC-3(5) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | SECURITY-RELEVANT INFORMATION
This F5 solution prevents access to organization-defined security-relevant information except during secure, non-operable system states. This is accomplished with the configuration of the corresponding logic in the F5 access policy definition, including configuration of services such as SSH and RDP gateway to access the security-relevant information in a secure manner, and is enforced for access to the individual infrastructure components of the solution such as the F5 appliances, the servers and the firewalls, as well as for access to the applications serviced and contained within this infrastructure.

#### AC-3(7) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL
This F5 solution enforces a role-based access control policy over defined subjects and objects and controls access based up organization-defined roles and users authorized to assume such roles, as defined in the organization's Azure AD. This is accomplished with the configuration of the corresponding logic in the F5 access policy definition and is enforced for access to the individual infrastructure components of the solution such as the F5 appliances, the servers and the firewalls, as well as for access to the applications serviced and contained within this infrastructure.

#### AC-3(8) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | REVOCATION OF ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS
This F5 solution enforces the revocation of access authorizations resulting from changes to the security attributes of subjects and objects based on organization-defined rules, immediately following the modification of the corresponding attributes defined in the organization's Azure AD or following the modification of the corresponding F5 access policy definition. This is accomplished with the configuration of the corresponding logic in the F5 access policy definition and is enforced for access to the individual infrastructure components of the solution such as the F5 appliances, the servers and the firewalls, as well as for access to the applications serviced and contained within this infrastructure.

#### AC-3(10) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | AUDITED OVERRIDE OF ACCESS CONTROL MECHANISMS

#### AC-4(4) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | CONTENT CHECK ENCRYPTED INFORMATION
This F5 solution prevents encrypted information from bypassing content-checking mechanisms by decrypting the information, blocking the flow of the encrypted information, terminating communications sessions attempting to pass encrypted information and/or applying any number of other organization-defined procedures or methods. This is accomplished with the configuration of the corresponding logic in the F5 SSL Orchestrator policy definition and is enforced for access to the individual infrastructure components of the solution such as the F5 appliances, the servers and the firewalls, as well as for access to the applications serviced and contained within this infrastructure.

#### AC-4(5) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | EMBEDDED DATA TYPES
This F5 solution enforces organization-defined limitations on embedding data types within other data types. This is accomplished with the configuration of the corresponding logic in the F5 SSL Orchestrator policy definition, which automatically scans the data contents and determines if other data types are embedded, and is enforced for access to the individual infrastructure components of the solution such as the F5 appliances, the servers and the firewalls, as well as for access to the applications serviced and contained within this infrastructure.

#### AC-4(6) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | METADATA

#### AC-4(8) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | SECURITY POLICY FILTERS
This F5 solution enforces information flow control using organization-defined security policy filters as a basis for flow control decisions for organization-defined information flows. This is accomplished with the configuration of the corresponding parameters and logic in the F5 WAF policy definition, and is enforced for access to the individual infrastructure components of the solution such as the F5 appliances, the servers and the firewalls, as well as for access to the applications serviced and contained within this infrastructure.

#### AC-4(9) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | HUMAN REVIEWS
This F5 solution enforces the use of human reviews for organization-defined information flows under organization-defined conditions. This is accomplished with the configuration of the corresponding parameters and logic in the F5 access and/or WAF policy definition, and is enforced for access to the individual infrastructure components of the solution such as the F5 appliances, the servers and the firewalls, as well as for access to the applications serviced and contained within this infrastructure.

#### AC-4(10) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | ENABLE / DISABLE SECURITY POLICY FILTERS
This F5 solution provides the capability for privileged administrators to enable/disable organization-defined security policy filters under organization-defined conditions. This is accomplished with the configuration of the corresponding parameters and logic in the F5 access and/or WAF policy definition, and is enforced for access to the individual infrastructure components of the solution such as the F5 appliances, the servers and the firewalls, as well as for access to the applications serviced and contained within this infrastructure.

#### AC-4(12) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DATA TYPE IDENTIFIERS
This F5 solution, when transferring information between different security domains, uses organization-defined data type identifiers to validate data essential for information flow decisions. This is accomplished with the configuration of the corresponding parameters and logic in the F5 access and/or WAF policy definition, and is enforced for access to the individual infrastructure components of the solution such as the F5 appliances, the servers and the firewalls, as well as for access to the applications serviced and contained within this infrastructure.

#### AC-4(13) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DECOMPOSITION INTO POLICY-RELEVANT SUBCOMPONENTS
The information system, when transferring information between different security domains, decomposes information into [Assignment: organization-defined policy-relevant subcomponents] for submission to policy enforcement mechanisms.

Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Policy enforcement mechanisms apply filtering, inspection, and/or sanitization rules to the policy-relevant subcomponents of information to facilitate flow enforcement prior to transferring such information to different security domains. Parsing transfer files facilitates policy decisions on source, destination, certificates, classification, attachments, and other security-related component differentiators.
